As a team we will design and create programs. Certain OpModes will be used on the Robot Controller(RC) phone an connect to the expansion hub which controls all the hardware
This connection is integral for actually running any programs.
The RC phone wirelessly connects to the Driver Station(DS) phone which can remotely run programs
Also provide a way for "gaming" controllers to control the robot when programmed correctly

We will creating programs for this purpose, without us all the work that the Design and Building team do is useless
We use FTC 2023-24 Centerstage SDK as a library for our programs
No need to clone that repository since you can clone this one
All original code for the Robot to be created, committed, and pushed will be located in: TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode

General Programming Guidelines:

Use descriptive and appropriate names for all identifiers (variables, method names, class names, constants, etc.).
Comment every 3-7 lines of code.
Be neat.

Use descriptive names for all variables, function names, constants, and other identifiers.
Use single letter identifiers only for the counter in loops.
Class names start with an upper case letter.
Variable names start with a lower case letter. (Variables include parameters, local variables, and data fields. Exception: use UPPER_CASE for constants - final variables.)
Method names start with a lower case letter.
Multi-word identifiers are internally capitalized.
Do not use hyphens or underscores to separate multi-word identifiers (except for constants, which have all upper case letters).

Comment Guidelines:

Comments should be descriptive and concise. 
Should mention the purpose of the code.
Should mention how it works including any algorithms present if applicable.
